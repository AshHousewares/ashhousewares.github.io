title: Why am I using GitHub?
I am currently an Investigator for a large metropolitan city. I thoroughly enjoy what I do but constantly find my mind wandering to different projects
that would make my life easier or provide me with enjoyment. My knowledge level with programming and engineering is minimal. It definitely is not 
enough to complete most of the ideas I come up with. That's why I created this GitHub. I want to learn and document how I applied that knowledge.
